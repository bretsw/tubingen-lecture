## Abstract

This study explores continuity and change in the cultures of two teaching-related subreddits. We collected 696,660 contributions to r/Teachers and 339,618 contributions to r/education between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2019. The affinity space concept framed our analysis in terms of individual contributions, content interactions, social interactions, topics, and forms of discourse. We discuss our findings in light of the extant literature as well as potential implications for practice and future research.
